# Data-structures-and-algorithms-1
- QT / C++. Programming assignment "Game of Taxes" and "Connecting Towns".

Programming assignment(s) for this course. The assignment had parts 1 and 2, but they are both combined in this file. 
Most of the files were given to students. My contribution in this is "datastructures.cc". Well, I also added a few functions and all of the private section in "datastructures.hh" to give myself some tools to work with. This should be documented in readme1 and readme2 -files. I also added all the estimates for average asymptotic efficiency in the .hh-file.
